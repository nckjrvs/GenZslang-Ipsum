# Stranger Ipsum V2

Built a Lorem Ipsum Generator that spits out Stranger Things quotes. [V1 was built with Node](https://github.com/robertcoopercode/stranger-ipsum/tree/v1.0.1) and this version is built with React.

You're able to select the number of paragraphs you'd like to generate and there is also a button that allows you to easily copy all the generated text.
